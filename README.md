# NSDC-JHSC Data Science Project Repository

This repository represents the collective work of the **NSDC-JHSC Data Science Team**, showcasing applied data science projects developed as part of our contribution to the **National Skill Development Corporation (NSDC)** community.

Our goal is to apply data-driven methodologies, machine learning, and analytical thinking to solve real-world problems and demonstrate the capabilities of our collaborative data science team.

---

## Overview

This repository is a collection of end-to-end **data science and machine learning projects**, covering domains such as recommendation systems, exploratory analysis, and data visualization.  
Each project has been implemented with professional standards — including data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model building, and insight generation.

All projects are organized in their respective folders and can be run independently using the provided Jupyter notebooks.

## Team Contribution

The **NSDC-JHSC Data Science Team** collaboratively contributed to:
- Research and dataset exploration  
- Designing machine learning workflows and pipelines  
- Performing exploratory data analysis and feature engineering  
- Building and validating predictive models  
- Communicating insights through data visualization and storytelling  

This repository is part of our continuous learning and contribution initiative to strengthen data science competency within the NSDC ecosystem.
